<p>Teachers are discovering that no matter how much novelty there is in
their entertainment, how well it is arranged, how thoroughly drilled,
if they want to hold the active interest of the audience they must use
the best of songs. The songs must be real novelties. The words must be
interesting as well as decidedly clever. The music must be catchy and
abounding in rich melody. With these things in mind we have prepared
this list of superior song novelties for our patrons. All are in
regular sheet music form.</p>

<div class="speaker">Rosie:</div> <p class="speech">Oh, <span class="smcap">Katie</span>, don’t you want a doll for
Christmas? I want one just awful, dreadful, <i>terrible</i> bad—not a
bad dolly, but I want it so bad that I just can’t tell you how bad.</p>

<div class="speaker">Katie:</div> <p class="speech">Now then, <span class="smcap">Rosie</span>, ain’t you the naughty girl to
be wanting a doll when dear <span class="smcap">Dannie</span> is trying to get his eyes
well? I don’t want <i>anything</i> if he can just be made to see, and
you know that takes lots of money.</p>

<div class="speaker">Rosie:</div> <p class="speech">Well, I guess I can wish for a dolly—wishing doesn’t
cost anything, does it? ’Course, I don’t mean I want it bought for me;
I just mean I want it. That isn’t the same, not a bit.</p>

<div class="speaker">Katie:</div> <p class="speech">Oh, I see! Well, I don’t even <i>want</i> anything,
only that <span class="smcap">Dannie</span> can get his eyes fixed. Just think,
<span class="smcap">Rosie</span>, if he could come home able to look at us. Wouldn’t that
be grand, now?</p>

<div class="speaker">Rosie:</div> <p class="speech">Oh, dear! Oh, boo-hoo-hoo! [<i>Rubs eyes.</i>]
Boo-hoo-hoo-hoo!</p>

<div class="speaker">Katie:</div> <p class="speech">[<i>putting arm about her</i>] W’y, <span class="smcap">Rosie</span>,
dear, what’s the matter? Is it sick you are? Does your stummick hurt,
<span class="smcap">Rosie</span>?</p>

<div class="speaker">Rosie:</div> <p class="speech">Oh, <span class="smcap">Katie</span>, w-w-what if—if— [<i>sobs</i>]
<span class="smcap">Dannie</span> can see an’ he don’t think I’m pretty? I—I’ve
got—freckles on my nose.</p>

<div class="speaker">Katie:</div> <p class="speech">[<i>patting her</i>] Now don’t you be worrying ’bout
freckles—they don’t hardly show a mite, honest. <span class="smcap">Dannie</span> will
think you look pretty, even if you ain’t, but you are.</p>

<div class="speaker">Rosie:</div> <p class="speech">But I’d like to have my hair all fixed with my nice
ribbon an’ be dressed up.</p>

just to see how nice we can make us look, just as if it were that
<span class="smcap">Dannie’s</span> comin’ home tonight. That’ll be fun. [<i>Claps hands
and dances about.</i>]</p>

<div class="speaker">Rosie:</div> <p class="speech">Sure, an’ it’ll make us forget that we can’t hang up
our stockings tonight. An’ I don’t want the doll <i>very</i> bad,
<span class="smcap">Katie</span>.</p>

<div class="speaker">Katie:</div> <p class="speech">Indeed you don’t if dear <span class="smcap">Dannie</span> comes home
so he sees us. Come on. [<i>They take hold of hands and run off
merrily.</i>]</p>

<div class="speaker">Mulligan:</div> <p class="speech">[<i>coming up to center, shaking head and

not be gittin’ a single bit of a Christmas prisint. [<i>Sits.</i>] But
what’s a poor workin’ man like mesilf to do whin Christmas comes round
an’ he hasn’t a cint left? Sure, there’s no father that’s wantin’ to
do better by his childer than I do, but with all of <span class="smcap">Dannie’s</span>

</p>

<div class="speaker">Mrs. M.:</div> <p class="speech">Now, <span class="smcap">Peter</span> man, what’s the trouble that’s
botherin’ ye so’s that ye look like as if there wasn’t a patch o’
sunshine as big as a pinhead left in the world? My, my, can’t ye look a
bit merrier than this on Christmas eve? An’ whin <span class="smcap">Dannie</span> who’s
niver looked out of his eyes all the years he’s lived, bless ’im, is
gettin’ ’em fixed so’s he can see.</p>

<div class="speaker">Mulligan:</div> <p class="speech">But <span class="smcap">Nora</span> darlin’, when a man’s got sich a
fine wife an’ sich fine childer as I’ve got, an’ likes to do well by
’em, it comes awful hard not to give ’em a bit of a treat at Christmas.
[<i>Sighs.</i>]</p>

<div class="speaker">Mrs. M.:</div> <p class="speech">[<i>putting hand on his shoulder</i>] Now,
<span class="smcap">Peter</span>, not a bit more of that! We are going to have a
wonderful Christmas, just in havin’ <span class="smcap">Dannie</span> come home so he can
see. Shame to think we need any prisint but that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span></p>

<div class="speaker">Mulligan:</div> <p class="speech">[<i>sadly</i>] Oh, <span class="smcap">Nora</span>, that’s one thing
that’s a botherin’ me. I wint over to the hospital tonight ’fore I came
home an’ they wouldn’t let me see ’im, not a-tall a-tall, I’m that
worried fer fear he ain’t a doin’ jist right that I scarce know if I’m
here or there, sure now.</p>

<div class="speaker">Mrs. M.:</div> <p class="speech">[<i>Shakes head.</i>] Dear, dear! [<i>Brightens.</i>]
But it’s not worryin’ we’ll be this night, whin it’s Christmas eve. I’m
sure that <span class="smcap">Dannie</span> is gettin’ along fine. Maybe they’re plannin’
to let ’im come home tomorry for a s’prise an’ had to keep ’im quiet.
Wouldn’t that be grand now?</p>

<div class="speaker">Mulligan:</div> <p class="speech">Let’s hope it’s so, <span class="smcap">Nora</span>. [<i>Sits with

<div class="speaker">Jones:</div> <p class="speech">Well, well! What’s <span class="smcap">Peter</span> weepin’ ’bout this
Christmas eve? [<i>Pulls out big colored handkerchief and wipes</i>

Santy won’t bring you any present. [<i>Laughs.</i>]</p>

<div class="speaker">Mulligan:</div> <p class="speech">[<i>Laughs.</i>] Quit pickin’ on a little feller
like me. Why don’t you be teasin’ <span class="smcap">Nora</span> here, if ye wants to
pick a quarrel?</p>

<div class="speaker">Jones:</div> <p class="speech">[<i>pretending fright</i>] Not the missis—I’ve seen
’er bring you to time with the rollin’ pin too often to make ’er mad at
me.</p>

<div class="speaker">Mrs. M.:</div> <p class="speech">[<i>laughing</i>] Shame now to speak so whin you know
me for the best natured lady that’s standin’ before ye at the prisint
time.</p>

<div class="speaker">Jones:</div> <p class="speech">Where’s the two pieces of mischief?</p>

<div class="speaker">Mrs. M.:</div> <p class="speech">[<i>innocently</i>] An’ who can ye mean?</p>

<div class="speaker">Jones:</div> <p class="speech">I mean those two girls that grow more like their mother
ev’ry day. They’ve got their father’s beauty an’ their mother’s temper.</p>

<div class="speaker">Mulligan:</div> <p class="speech">[<i>laughing</i>] Hivin pity ’em!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span></p>

<div class="speaker">Mrs. M.:</div> <p class="speech">Now see ye here, <span class="smcap">Bill Jones</span>, I was goin’ to
make ye a nice cookie cut in shape of a pig fer a Christmas prisint,
but I’ll not do it if ye don’t be after quittin’ an’ go to behavin’.</p>

<div class="speaker">Jones:</div> <p class="speech">[<i>folding hands piously</i>] If I quit a-tall I’ll
have to quit behavin’ ’cause I’m always good. My mother says I’m the
best boy she’s got—the other six boys bein’ girls. But tell me now,
where’s <span class="smcap">Rosie</span> an’ <span class="smcap">Katie</span>?</p>

<div class="speaker">Mulligan:</div> <p class="speech">Sure, they’re in their room fixin’ up tryin’ to see
how nice they can make themselves look ’cause they want <span class="smcap">Dannie</span>
to think they’re pretty when he sees ’em.</p>

<div class="speaker">Mrs. M.:</div> <p class="speech">Now what a notion! But still, it’s a good one.
<span class="smcap">Dannie</span> niver has seen a one of us an’ we’d all ought to look
as fine as possible when he first lays eyes on us.</p>

<div class="speaker">Jones:</div> <p class="speech">Say, if that’s so, I’ll have to go out an’ try to order
me a new face. No use in tryin’ to fix this one up so’s it’ll look
han’some.</p>

<div class="speaker">Mrs. M.:</div> <p class="speech">Now, now, <span class="smcap">Mister Jones</span>, I know many a lady
would think ye’re a fine-lookin’ man.</p>

<div class="speaker">Jones:</div> <p class="speech">[<i>excitedly</i>] Where’s one of ’em? I’ll take ’er to
the movies an’ buy ’er a sack of popcorn.</p>

<div class="speaker">Mulligan:</div> <p class="speech">I guess I’ll have to brush up some ’fore

<div class="speaker">Katie:</div> <p class="speech">Of course not. We’re just trying to see if we could fix
so our <span class="smcap">Dannie’ll</span> think we’re pretty when he sees us. Do you
’spose he will?</p>

I’ve got my pretty ribbon on?</p>

tell the policeman on you.</p>

<div class="speaker">Jones:</div> <p class="speech">[<i>striking attitude</i>] Who’s ’fraid of a policeman?
If he says anything to me I’ll eat him up.</p>

<div class="speaker">Rosie:</div> <p class="speech">[<i>pointing finger</i>] Shame to talk so! Santa Claus

<div class="speaker">Mulligan:</div> <p class="speech">[<i>sighing</i>] I guess he won’t bring any of yez a

doctors say they think the dear boy is goin’ to see, bless ’im, an’ we

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms

posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
